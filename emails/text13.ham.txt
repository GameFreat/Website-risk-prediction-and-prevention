Dear All,

I am repeating ,the damage has happened on its own and not from our side.
I can't understand whether you people cannot identify normal damage and troubling the customer saying flimsy excuses.
We expected good service from HP and this is an irresponsible response from your side.

I feel that you are raising all these excuses only for not providing us the warranty which we are eligible for.

I once again request you to rectify the same under the warranty.
We require the same urgently since my two children are doing their online classes. I is already more than 10 days.

Pl rectify the same under the warranty and hand over the laptop to us at the earliest
If my genuine complaint is not properly addressed, I will be camplaining to other forums including consumer redressal.

I am actually fed up with your service and your delaying tactics.Being a customer I have purchased this laptop only expecting good service.

There are other similar good branded laptops available in the market with lesser price . I chose HP paying higher price only expecting good service and this type of response was totally unexpected and shocking.

Under what circumstances are you irritating the customer with flimsy excuses inorder to extract money from the customer by not covering under warrenty.

I expect a positive response from your side
