i guess i should start with you're amazing! we've known each other since 2nd grade and you don't believe how much you've changed. 
you're way taller than me and your voice got seriously low. 
you have a newfound respect for yourself and you understand me more than anyone could ever have. 
you helped me understand that i don't have to act that everything is ok even when my world is just falling apart. 
you were there 7 moths ago when my brother got cancer, you were there when my dad died, and you were there when i thought i didn't know who i was anymore. 
you were there to cheer me up and defend me from people that didn't understand. 
i don't know if i love you because that is a pretty strong word for someone my age, but i know that i will definitely do anything for you. 
because no matter how different we are, we're still friends. please know that i will always be there for you and the memories we have together will always be with me. 
i remember how i tutored you after school all the time because i was surprisingly good at math, ss, and everything else. 
i remember how you caught me when i fell in basketball because i am a total klutz. 
i remember how you stayed in my house till 2:00am eating cookie and drinking milk on a school night for some project. 
i remember the countless times when i begged and begged and begged you for forgiveness when i made mistakes. 
i remember how people said we were perfect together. you being popular because you played drums and were a total techno freak gamer 
who naturally attracted people and me being the pretty smart and artistic class president who used to be very mean to boys until you. you changed me and you refuse to believe it. 
i used to call you weird and you said i was weird too. then i said we were both weird and you said we were just technically educated ;) i care about you with all my heart and there is nothing NOTHING that can keep us apart!
