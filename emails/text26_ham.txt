Dear [NAME],

I’m writing to ask your support in helping kids at [SCHOOL NAME] start to take charge of the wired world at our Hour of Code event in December.

Sponsored by Code.org, the Hour of Code is a first step in addressing the need for computer science education in the nation’s schools. The event is part of Computer Science Education Week and aims to give students their first taste of coding via a series of engaging tutorials.

Most of us have a vague idea that a knowledge of computer science will help you get a job, but the actual numbers are pretty shocking:

Software powers our economy, but, less than 2.4 percent of college students graduate with a CS degree. That means there aren’t going to be enough graduates to fill the jobs. To make matters worse, 95 percent of our schools don’t teach programming.

That’s what we’re looking to change.

To that end, we’re respectfully requesting donations of time (1 hour of in-class mentoring during the Hour of Code), computer hardware [SPECIFY TYPE], or donations of prizes [EXAMPLES] to further our Hour of Code efforts. We’d love your help.

Thank you for considering this request. If you have any questions, please contact me at [EMAIL] or [PHONE]. I will follow up with you shortly.
