Joe,

My name is John Fanselow.　 I was the Director of the TESOL Program at
Teachers College, Columbia University in Tokyo and New York prior to my
retirement.　 I was also president, second vice president and program chair　
of TESOL and president of NYSTESOL.　

During the years, I have done many workshops for JALT and other
affiliates. Breaking Rules, Contrasting Conversations, both from Longman　　
and Try the Opposite by SIMUL are the books some know me by.

I am now president of a 500 student college in New Zealand which has　
many Japanese students.　 Part of my role as president is to meet parents
of students in Japan.　 On my trips to Japan, I usually do workshops.　
Some of these my college--International Pacific College--has arranged.
Sometimes, teachers at schools arrange the workshops and sometimes
JALT chapters have arranged them.

I was wondering whether you would have any interest in co-sponsoring a
workshop for the Hiroshima chapter.　 Monday 11 November in the
evening--4-6? or 5-7?　 that I will be in Hiroshima and will be free.　 (Free　
both in the sense of available and free in the sense that I am volunteering　
my services.)
