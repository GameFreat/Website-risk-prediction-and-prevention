The JEE Mains and NEET 2020 dates have been announced but the situation for students will be chaotic as a lot of public transport is still shut down because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many students are not financially capable of spending to travel down to the testing centres from their homes. Sign my petition asking the government to provide transport to JEE-NEET students. We must ensure all students have equal opportunity in these exams.

The dates of JEE Mains and NEET 2020 are finally announced by the Supreme Court and is tend to be scheduled in first two weeks of September.

Definitely its a situation of chaos for all the students, but a bigger problem for them who live in remote parts of the country and are not financially well. Its a very tough task for them to even reach the center to appear for exam in the situation when no means of Public Transport are in operations.

The one who has prepared throughout the year just for appearing in an exam and if fails to do so just because of no proper transportation facilities, its definitely a matter of fact for the whole country.

We demand that the National Testing Agency (NTA) and Education Ministry should  look into the matter and make some special arrangements for the students from remote locations and the one who is not from well to do family, so that they can reach their assigned centers safely even during this Covid-Crisis.
