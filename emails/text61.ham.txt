I've been meaning to write to everyone. But my life has just turned
upside down the past few months. So, I'm glad you wrote. And thank you
for the complement. You've always been very kind and supportive. I like
you as well, and wish you all the luck at Hirodai and where ever else
you and your family may go. And, thank you for your best wishes.

Yes, I've "escaped" Hirodai, but not under the circumstance I would have
wished. In fact, I'm rather sad and disappointed that Koto-Sensei has
not made clear my reasons for resigning. Both of my parents have been
quite ill. I asked for an additional six months leave to stay and take
care of my parents. Koto sent me this amazing letter saying that while
he thinks it was good for society that a law was passed making it
possible for people to take compassion leave, no one should actually
apply for the leave. Well, any way, he made it very clear to me what was
expected of me after I returned, and why I should return. After thinking
about it for some time, I realized that if I did return then I'd still
have to fly back to the USA often to take care of my parents; thus, I
couldn't fulfill my responsibilities to Hirodai. It would also be an
awful burden financially. I saw little options but to resign.

Resigning has been a disaster for my career. I am currently unemployed.

You are free to talk about this with others, but I will circulate a letter of
my own soon. Right now, things are rather crazy. We're moving once
again, something like the fourth time this year, and I've got a conference
to prepare for.

Take care and say hi to Sachiko and George for us!
