Dear Harveen,

Although we have not talked as much as we used to back in Secondary school, I still am missing you so very much. You know how they always say, best friends are hard to come by, indeed, friends like you are the reason why I am still able to carry on living like there's no tomorrow.
I must admit sometimes when you try to start a conversation with me, I get all grumpy and moody, but that is only because you're so good at picking the wrong time that I have to force myself to smile and happily talk to you even when I don't feel that way at all.
Best friend, don't ever change, stay awesome, pretty, caring and amazing, and you know what, when you smile, I'll smile with you; when you cry, I'll say: "oh purlease, there are plenty of fish in the sea, shut it!"

BBF that you adore so much,
Vivian
