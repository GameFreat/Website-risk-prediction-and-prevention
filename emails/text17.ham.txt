Dear Miles,

It's nice to have met you. We've been friends for God-knows-how-long, and you're always there for me. Thank you so much for the love and care. I may not be the best 'best friend', but you will always be the best personal body guard for me(hehe). If ever you feel sad, remember that I am here.

Even if we live a thousand lives, I will always pick you as my beloved best friend.

And I'm sorry I always burn the hell out of the eggs that I cook for you, but I'm sure you're too kind to even tell me to stop trying before I burn down the house.

And I'm sorry I copy your Math assignment all the time. 
I mean, I suck at Math and I need to because I'm too lazy to do my Math hw. 
I mean, I let you copy my English work, so...I guess it's fair?

Anyway, it's fun being with you. Hope you never change. 
And yes, sorry for calling you names.

Faithfully yours,
Anna.
