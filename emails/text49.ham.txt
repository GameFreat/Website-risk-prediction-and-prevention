Hi Professor Lauer,

I was asked by Mr. Nagai, the leader of our tennis club to let you know　
that we have made plans for a tennis camp, which is to be held on Nov.
23-24 at Taishakukyou.

We hope you will join the camp. If it's impossible, how about coming on　
either of the two days? I guess we can enjoy seeing autumn leaves as　
well as playing tennis.

All the best.
C. Iwasaki
