I hope you are all staying safe. Thanks to all of you who have been writing to me about the courses in which you’re enrolled in my Coursera specialization on blockchain. Many have asked me about where to continue the learning. Below is a resource that you may find useful to continue the journey you started with the blockchain courses.

I have been writing a practical hands-on book to design and develop smart contracts and end-to-end decentralized applications on the Ethereum platform. It is almost finished. Fantastic people from Manning publishers have been helping me put together a highly useful book for learners at all levels: K-12 to college students, freelancers, and managers eager to learn about blockchain programming. If you have been thinking about a book on blockchain, here it is: https://www.manning.com/books/blockchain-in-action

This book picks up where the Coursera specialization ends. 
It begins with the familiar ballot smart contract, but the book has five more fully working Dapps. 
The design and development of each of these Dapp focuses on a specific aspect of blockchain. 
Several essential tools (Remix, Ganache, MetaMask, Truffle, Ropsten, and Infura) and techniques (encryption and digital signing) are introduced to demonstrate the development and deployment of Dapps on the Ethereum test chain. 
The core ideas of blockchain—trust and integrity, security and privacy, on-chain and off-chain data, and operations—are covered in detail with examples. 
The blockchain concepts are explained with more than 150 annotated figures and screenshots. 
Please check it out. I hope it helps you continue the learning you began with Coursera blockchain specialization.
