Dear Parents,

We live in a world surrounded by technology. And we know that whatever field our students choose to go into as adults, their ability to succeed will increasingly hinge on understanding how technology works. But only a tiny fraction of us are learning computer science, and fewer students are studying it than a decade ago.

Thatâ€™s why our entire school joined in on the largest education event in history: The Hour of Code. During Computer Science Education Week (Dec. 7-13), every one of our students will be amongst over 2 million worldwide spending one hour learning the basics.

Our Hour of Code is a statement that [SCHOOL NAME] is ready to teach these foundational 21st century skills. To continue bringing programming activities to your students, we want to make our Hour of Code event huge. I encourage you to reach out to local media, share the news on your social media channels and consider hosting additional Hour of Code events in your outside of school, in the community.

This is a chance to change the future of education in [TOWN/CITY NAME].


Sincerely,

Your principal
