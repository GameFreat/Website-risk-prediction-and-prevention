Dear Dennis,

Hope you are well.

I'm writing to you, yet again, in your capacity as "Answer Man."

One of our David English House teachers has just e-mailed me to see if I
have any more information on "university listening tests" which are to be
administered soon.

I have no information about any such tests.　 Do you?　 If so, could you
please let me know.

Thank you kindly.

Best regards,
Donna
