Professor [last name],

I hope your week is going well. 
I am in your [class name] class at [class time] and have enjoyed my experience so far. 
This is a specific topic Iâ€™d love to spend more time and effort on,
as I realize it will have a big impact on my overall grade and I want to do all I can to ensure 
I am best prepared. Would you be willing to spend a few extra minutes with me before or after class? 
I have a few quick questions on how I can best learn this topic to improve my grade. 
Thank you for your time and looking forward to the next class!
