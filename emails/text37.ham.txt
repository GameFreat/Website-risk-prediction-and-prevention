Dear Spencer:

I wanted to drop you a note to thank you for the great work you did in building and launching the redesign of our company website. 
Since the go-live, I’ve received several glowing comments from clients who are thrilled with the new look of our product catalogue and 
with the improved ease of the website’s navigation system.

I also appreciate the extra time you took to train me and our business team in how to correctly enter new text and visuals into the website. 
None of us were familiar with web design or coding before, but your training and the manual / process checklist you wrote for us will ensure that we’ll easily be able to make changes to the website as needed.

You were a pleasure to work with. 
Please call upon me should you ever need a positive testimonial to use on your own website.

Thanks again,
