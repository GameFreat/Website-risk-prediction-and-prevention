Hi Dennis,

After the exciting Saturday, I guess you've been doing as good as that
Saturday.　 The weather is good, food is good, and studying is good in this
season.　 I like this season the best.

Oh, well, this introduction may remind you of students' writing, so I
should stop it now.　 To make a long story short (or the introduction　
short?), I am sending you this message to say thank you.　 I said so for　
the Saturday already.　 Today's "thank you" is to the vocabulary test,　
which was delivered to me today.　 On the letter from Professor Tanaka,　
your name was also written, so I assume that you and Prof. Tanaka　
worked together to develop this test.　 To tell you the truth, I like it, and I　
do want to use it for my research and classes.　 He said that an online　
delivery is being planned.　 I wonder if anyone can use the test.　 If so, this　
is really great.

Sending you a thank-you message, I would like to ask you a favor.　 The
attached is a thank-you letter to　 Prof. Tanaka.　 Would it be too much to
ask you to print it out and hand it to him?　 If so, would you send me back
a "Do it yourself" message.　 I'll send it by regular mail.　 Or would you let　
me know his mail address.　 (I hope he is a regular mail user.　 In our school,
there are still quite a few senior professors who don't use e-mail at all.
Yes, AT ALL!　 Can you believe that?)

OK, Dennis, sorry for interrupting you with my favor.　 Hope to see you
soon again.　

Best wishes,
