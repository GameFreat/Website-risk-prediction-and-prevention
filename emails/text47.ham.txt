Hi George,
Thanks for your reply.　 You are always so quick!

I sent an-mail to Mr. Imai of Seibido yesterday, and I just got a phone call
from him.　 They want us to send the whole thing and also a "Project　
Plan."　 It seems that they have some form to fill in to describe the project　
in Japanese, so I will write something which will appeal to the publsiher.

That's all for now.　 Let's hope it will come out!
