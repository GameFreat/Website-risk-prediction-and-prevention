Dear Ray,

Thanks for your e-mail.

I am leaving for Cambodia on Dec. 12 and return to Hiroshim on Jan. 12.
This means that I will have to miss only one class on Dec. 16.
Unfortunately, my friend won't be able to teach that class since he is not
sure if he can make it on time.

I am still interested in teaching the course if you can find any other
teacher to replace me on Dec. 16.

Bye now,

Bill
