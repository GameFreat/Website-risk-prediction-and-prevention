Hello Amal,

I hope this message finds you well. 
I’m reaching out today because I’m managing an application redesign project here at ABC Company and seeking a skilled UX research contractor to help analyze several sets of usability testing data.

This is a three-month project beginning February 1st, and we estimate it will take roughly 15 hours per week. 
All work can be completed remotely, but you’re welcome to use our workspace.

Please let me know if you’re interested in this project and we can set up some time to discuss the details further. 
I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,
