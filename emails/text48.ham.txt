Dear Prof. Lauer,

I hope you are doing fine. I am now in Saitama, but will go back to
Hiroshima to attend the conference. We would like to visit you to say　
thank　 you for your cooperation. During this week, WED, THU, and FRI,　
please let me know when you will be in your office. We would like to visit　
you shortly.

Sincerely,
Toshiko
