Dear Name of Employer:

This email is to inform you that I need to take emergency leave starting today. 
My daughter just called me to inform me that my wife collapsed in the grocery store and has been taken to a Hospital.
I plan to return to work the day after tomorrow  because 
I need a day to arrange for someone to come live in our home for a few days until my wife is discharged from the hospital.

I have informed my colleagues of my situation and am assured that my work will not suffer during this time. I can be reached at Phone Number at any time if you have any questions or would like more information. I can also be reached at Email Address.

Thank you for your consideration at this unsettling time. I look forward to receiving a positive response.

Sincerely,
