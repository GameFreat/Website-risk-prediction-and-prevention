Subject: Complaint regarding the quality of the headphones

Hi there,

I purchased the headphones at Perfect Music on Monday, August 11. Later, I discovered that the left headphone wasn’t working. Unfortunately, the staff refused to replace the headphones or return my money although I provided the receipt.

I’m deeply disappointed about the quality of the product and the disrespectful treatment I received in your store.

I hope to have this issue resolved and get my money back, otherwise, I will have to take further actions.

Best,
