Hi Everyone!
Thought I'd send out a picture of my little monsters.　 They had a great　
Halloween yesterday.　 Doreen and Dennis came over to hand out candy so
Ray and I were both able to go out with the kids.　 They made quite the
haul, the dentist is going to love us!

Doreen and Dennis left this morning for Wisconsin.　 They hope to get to
Idaho today.　 Judy, you should be seeing them sometime next week.　 I
hope they have good weather.　 They'll be back here in time for　
Thanksgiving.

I hope you all have a great weekend!

Love, Sue.
