Subject: Enquiry about Conference Centre Timings

Dear sir/madam,

I am writing to enquire about the timings for the conference centre at {place}. 
Our company is hosting a delegation from {place} and is interested in booking the centre for an important corporate event on {date}. 
I checked your website but could not find the information I require.

If you could kindly send across the timings when the conference centre is available, 
we can design an itinerary at the earliest and share the schedule with you to initiate the booking procedure.
Looking forward to an early response.

Thanks,
