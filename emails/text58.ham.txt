Dear Professor Lauer

Having had some trouble calling you, I did drop in last Monday, but I have
since seen Abdellah who told me he'd seen you and you don't go in on
Monday's.

How about you nominate a time for me to call you, or nominate a time for　
me to come and see you or, you can call me if it's easier because I am
mostly here in my wee apartment.

Please let me know.　 If you want to call the number is 21-5815.
Otherwise, I'm happy to fit in with you.

Kind regards,

　Aisha
