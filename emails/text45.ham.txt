Dear Ray,

How are you?　

I think I haven't told you yet.　 After workin for　 Kobe Kaisei Girls' Junior　
High School, I got a job here at Kure National College of Technology.

Anyway, coming home to Hiroshima, I resumed my research. I know what I
have to do first: To publish the dissertation of mine ... When I was in Kobe,
it was too difficult.

These days I finally finished writing a summary in English,　 which is　
required for publication.　 Prof. YAMADA gave me　 some comments.　 But I
wonder if it is free of any unnaturalness.　 Could you have a look at the
attached file (it is the summary in question) and give me comments?　
I'm not in such a hurry.

Best wishes
