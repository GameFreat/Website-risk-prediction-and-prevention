Subject: Complaint against Gender Discrimination in the Office

Dear Mr./Ms. {Recipient’s name}

This is to bring to your notice an instance of discrimination on the basis of gender in the office. 
I was due for a meeting with {name, department} this month, and was surprised to see that I was dropped from the plan at the last minute. 
In a conversation with {name of offending person} on {date} about it, I was told that the move was taken because they did not feel I would land the deal as a woman and that “it was best left to the men”.

I have worked tirelessly in the company for the last period of time.
Given the reputation of {Name of Company} as a female-friendly and discrimination-free workplace, 
and I am appalled at being treated like this.

I have previously raised this issue privately with {name of offending person} but failed to receive an apology or a satisfactory response. 
I wish to pursue this further with this official complaint and come to a swift and fitting solution with the help of Human Resources and other members of Management.

Hoping to see this matter dealt with at the earliest,
