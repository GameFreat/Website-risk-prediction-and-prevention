Subject Line: Marketing Meeting Canceled

Hi team,

The marketing strategy meeting scheduled for this afternoon has been canceled.

I apologize for the late notice, but I know everyone will welcome the extra time back in their day. 
We will reconvene at our regularly scheduled time next Wednesday.

Thanks,
